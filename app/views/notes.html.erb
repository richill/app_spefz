Hi Ashon,
 
Further to our phone conversation this afternoon, I can confirm we are very experienced with dealing with Stripe and can deal with most issues or integration problems that are faced.
 
If anyone you know needs our help, please get them to contact the office on 01376 44 00 23 or email me directly and we can discuss the issues to see if we can help.
Thank you for you call.
