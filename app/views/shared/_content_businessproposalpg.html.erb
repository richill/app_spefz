            <p>Since early 2017, Spefz Ltd has been aiming to focus on helping its members effectively meet, network and connect with ambitious, like-minded people of their calibre through social dating & networking events. Our Team and Webapp platform brings and contributes a wealth of knowledge and experience that is unmatched in the event dating/networking industry.</p>
            <p>
              <b>Why We Do What We Do</b><br/>
              <span>We are passionate about connecting the right people via live events. We believe these days a lot of social dating & networking events are focused mainly on gathering random individuals to an event. We would like to be a part of changing that by gathering individuals of similar interests and personality traits at an event, thus increasing the likely hood of members being connected with other members of their calibre and preference.</span>

              <b>What problem are we solving?</b><br/>
              <span>Our research suggests that, while there is a number of specialist dating events based on ethnicity, culture, religion, sex-orientation, age, professionals etc, most of these specialist-dating events do not analyze their matches for their live dating events. They host their live dating events based on grouping people but not based on a match analyses on interest, preferences, personality and appearance, rather than focusing on gethering a set of people of the same physical attraction & personality. This results in the increased probability of unsuccessful matches between members at live dating events. </span>
            </p>
            <p>To ensure real people are able to meet like-minded singles, we've created a algorithm rating system on appearance and personality. This ensures that compatibility and mutual interests prevail. Does this take time? Yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely!</p>

            <p><b>How do we solve the problem?</b><br/>
            <span>To ensure real people are able to meet like-minded singles we have an inbuilt algorithm rating and matching system for our live dating events. This algorithm automatically calculates the average rating of each member, uses this average rating to auto-match each member to a specific live dating event (where members with similar average rating score will be present). Our Spefz Team then also takes advantage of the available stats on each member and takes the initiative to introduce members with very close rating scores with one another. The introduction and automated process ensures members are able to meet and connect with like-minded singles and therefore increasing the likelihood of successful matches at each event.</span></p>

            <span>We believe our inbuilt rating algorithm will attract users to attend our events – which most of our competitors do not have – Most of our competitors focus more on gathering random singles who are willing to pay to attend an event. We want to gather and group singles of similar interest, so the potential of members connecting will be much higher. We believe our users are likely to attend our events as we auto-match individuals to specific events (via our internal rating algorithm system based on personality, physical appearance and interests) in order to ensure they are able to network effectively and meet like-minded people of their calibre.</span></p>

            <p>With my few years of experience in the event sector, i have seen this gap in the online events dating market, and I believe an online dating events platform that calculates a members stats and screens through each member in order to increase the probability of successful matches at live dating events is much needed. Using my skills, and experience in this space, I believe that I can turn this business into a great success and commercialise this platform to generate sustainable turnover and profitability.</p>
