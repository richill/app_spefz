              <p>Spefz is a speed-netwroking & a social life app. We believe meeting people is best done in rela life, preferably over a glass of wine. Our events and socials offer busy professionals a great way to meet new people in a fun, safe and chilled environment.</p>

              <p>We organise a range of netwroking events such as elite professionals, graduate professionals, silent-networking, speed-dating, wine tasting, quiz nights and more. We intend to create a place that combines having fun with new people offline, and a place to stay in touch with them online as your new network grows.</p>




              <p>----------------</p>

           

            



              <p>The latest pop-ups and art shows, running in the parks, a glass of wine after work or a coffee and Sunday movie - the community host socials for each other and invite to you to join them.</p>

              <p>Knowing how tough it could be to meet new likeminded people in cities - whether to find a better social life or being new to a city - we nurtured our first real world community in London and today have grown to every major city in the UK, New York, Chicago and Washington.</p>

            

              <p>In the case of an Employment engagement, the Employer may elect to pay one of the following two Success Fee options: 
                <ul>
                  <li>(1) the Employer may pay a Success Fee equal to 15% of the Prospective Employee’s first year base salary (an “Upfront Success Fee”), which amount shall be due and payable thirty (30) days after the Start Date (the “Upfront Success Fee Option”); OR </li>
                  <li>(2) in the event that Africanjober in its sole discretion has approved the Employer to pay on a monthly basis (the “Monthly Success Fee Option”), the Employer may pay a monthly Success Fee equal to 2% of the Employee’s first year base salary (a “Monthly Success Fee”), with the first payment due on the Start Date and each subsequent payment due monthly thereafter for ten (10) months until the earlier of (a) payment of ten Monthly Success Fee installments or (b) termination of the Prospective Employee for whom the Monthly Success Fee Option was selected.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <p>Employers granted the Monthly Success Fee option are required to (1) complete the Africanjober Direct Debit Authorization Form allowing Africanjober to directly withdraw, debit or charge monthly payments from Employer’s designated bank or credit card account(s) and (2) be subject to a credit review.</p>
