              <p><b>Do you charge extra for credit card transactions?</b> To defray the substantial charges we incur when processing credit cards, we now charge a handling fee for all transactions of more than £100. This is set at 2.5 percent of the total transaction for all credit cards. We do not charge for debit cards or Electron cards. For transactions of less than £100 we absorb the cost ourselves.</p>

Just click Make Payment to go to the payment page. This will show you what packages we have, and any special offers we may have. We accept the majority of credit and debit cards. We do not hold any card details on our servers, which ensures maximum safety for your details. You can in special circumstances use alternative methods of payment - by calling our call centre on 0131 608 0066. Please note we no longer accept payment by cheque/postal order.

I have a problem with payments, where can I get help?
Please email us: admin@speeddater.co.uk or call 0131 608 0066

I've been given some membership to SpeedDater. Has my card been charged?
We have probably given you a free trial for SpeedDater online dating. Your card will never be charged without your explicit permission. Please note that the membership is on repeat billing and will renew after the month membership is near the end. You will need to cancel this if you do not wish to be charged.

I've signed up for a SpeedDater online dating membership with auto-renewal but would now like to cancel?
If you want to cancel your membership before your billing has expired, you will need to cancel any repeat billing first. You will have full access to the site until the payment expires. You can then remove your account. 
To cancel your repeat billing:
1. Click on the "My Account" link.
2. Click on the "Cancel Repeat Billing" link.

Under our terms and conditions we do not refund membership fees.

My credit card has been rejected by your payment system. Why?
There may be a number of reasons why your card has not been accepted. These include:
* You may simply have entered an invalid card number. The most likely reasons for this are that you have mistyped the card number or missed some of the digits, or you have not entered the card number we need. Please try again, checking your typing carefully.
* The card type you have specified (e.g. Visa, Debit) does not appear to match the card number supplied. Please go back and check that the card type selected is correct.
* Your bank has declined to authorize payment for this amount.
* Your card may be of the type that requires the cardholder to be present, and is therefore not suitable for telephone/internet bookings.
* We regret that we are currently unable to accept American Express cards.

What happens after I pay?
Once you have paid, your account is immediately activated, and your period of subscription starts. You will receive an email notifying you of your payment. This acts as your payment receipt and the reference on it should be used if you need to contact us for any reason. Your ability to have full access to the site is confirmation from us that we have actioned your payment.

What if I don't want to pay by credit card?
Please note we no longer accept payments by cheque or postal order. Please call us on 0131 608 0066 if you are unable to pay by debit/credit card. Cash payments can be made at our singles parties on the door (depending on availability of course), however this will be at full price and any early bird discounts will not be applied.

When will my mobile phone payment go through and when will my membership be upgraded?
No money will be taken from your account until you receive sms messages from us and reply to the first one with "Y". That's why there is a delay in upgrading your membership which may take up to 3-4 hours. Payments made by mobile phone are not taken at once, you can only pay £30 per day. Please don't try to pay again until the whole sum is taken which may not be until the following day.

Will my card be automatically re-billed at the end of my membership?
Only if you ticked one of the 'auto-renewal' options when you upgraded to Platinum membership.
