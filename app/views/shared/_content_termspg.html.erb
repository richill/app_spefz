              <p><b>Continuous Service Agreement </b>spefz operates a Continuous Service Agreement for our Membership Fees that users can terminate themselves at any time. This means that spefz automatically renews your membership when it’s about to expire unless user has terminated this. Continuous service rates apply to credit/debit card payments only and are applicable both if you join as a member online or we manually process your card details. All amounts are billed in UK sterling, $ or €, dependent on the country in which you reside, at the beginning of each renewal period. Your spefz membership subscription will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected at the then-current membership subscription rate. To change or resign your subscription at any time, please see section titled ‘Termination’ below. If you cancel your full membership, you'll enjoy full membership benefits until the end of your then-current subscription term; your subscription won't be renewed after that term expires. However, you won't be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fees paid.</p>

              <p><b>Fees Assessed by Organizers or Creators or Hosts;</b> Payments to Organizers or Creators or Hosts. Some Organizers or Creators or Hosts may require or request fees for participation in a spefz social, or for attendance at spefz social or spefz events. Individual spefz group membership fees, spefz social fees or other event fees are at the discretion of each Organizer or Creator or Host, who decides whether such fees are required, the amount frequency, payment options, refund policies, and how such fees are spent. Fees assessed by Organizers or Creators or Hosts are remitted to the Organizer or Creator or Host and not to spefz. To the extent that you use Amazon Payments, PayPal or another payment mechanism (e.g., check or cash), to pay fees assessed by an Organizer or Creator or Host, you acknowledge that spefz does not control the transaction, and that you bear all risk in connection with the transaction. Refunds of any payment you make to any Organizer or Creator or Host are subject to that Organizer's or Creator's or Host's policies and applicable law. If you believe any payment to an Organizer or Creator or Host is in error, you must contact the Organizer or Creator or Host to seek resolution. You should use common sense and be careful in deciding whether to make a payment to an Organizer or Creator or Host. Organizers or Creators or Hosts have full discretion whether and how to spend money in connection with their spefz socials or events. We cannot ensure that an Organizer or Creator or Host is legitimate and truthful, that he or she will use payments as promised, or that you will be happy with how your payment is spent. Your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in promotions of spefz events/socials, including payment and related services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and the applicable Organizer or Creator or Host.</p>

              <p><b>Coupon Codes;</b> We may from time to time offer promotions where we may discount or waive certain spefz fees or other fee-based products or services. We may offer coupon codes as a mechanism for processing a discount or credit. Coupon codes have no cash value, are not retroactive, and unless specified, are non-transferable and expire within 30 days of date of issue. Additionally, we may ship free spefz promotional materials to an address you specify in order to promote your spefz social or group, or we may offer your spefz social or group third party sponsorship opportunities ("Sponsorships").</p>

              <p><b>Termination of Membership</b> A Member may terminate their paid subscription via the Settings area of the site. If your request for termination is received before your next payment is due, your paid membership status will last until the end of the original subscription period paid for. If your request for subscription membership termination is received before your next payment is due, but you have booked onto a social that is due to take place after the date that your paid-for subscription period is due to end, you must cancel your place at the social before terminating your paid membership subscription. spefz may terminate or suspend the membership of any Member at any time for any reason whatsoever. A Member may close their spefz account entirely at any time by visiting their Settings page, clicking on "Close my account" link and confirming this action.</p>
