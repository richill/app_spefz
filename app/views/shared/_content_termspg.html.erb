              <div class="major_header">Payments and Refunds</div>
              <p><b>For Prospective Employees</b> Africanjober is free for Prospective Employees. A Prospective Employee agrees to promptly notify Africanjober if the Prospective Employee (1) accepts an offer of employment (an “Employment Offer”), whether for an indefinite or fixed term, (2) accepts an offer of employment as a contractor or consultant (a “Consulting Engagement”), whether for an indefinite or fixed term, (3) accepts an Employment Offer or a Consulting Engagement during or within twelve (12) months after termination of an Internship (as defined below) of any duration (a) with an Employer who was identified by the Prospective Employee through the use of our Site or Service or (b) from an Employer who identified the Prospective Employee through the use of our Site or Service, or (4) accepts an Employment Offer made by an Employer during or within twelve (12) months after termination of a Consulting Engagement with such Employer, each of the above a “Covered Offer”. Subject to the Prospective Employee complying with the terms of this Section 7 (Payment and Refunds), Africanjober will pay the Prospective Employee an amount based upon Africanjober employee bonus scale for the geographical region in which the Prospective Employee works for the Employer (the “Prospective Employee Payment”); the Prospective Employee Payment will be made no later than 120 days after the Start Date of the Prospective Employee with an Employer pursuant to an Employment Offer for full time employment of an indefinite term. The date on which a Prospective Employee commences work under an Employment Offer or Consulting Engagement is the “Start Date”. For the purposes hereof, an Internship shall refer to an opportunity for a Prospective Employee to work, as an intern or pursuant to a co-op arrangement, for an Employer for a fixed period of time to assess job skills and shall only apply to Prospective Employees that are enrolled in college or graduate school, or who have graduated from college or graduate school in the past 6 months.</p>

              <p>If you are a Prospective Employee who is using our Site and/or Service, you agree that (1) if you receive a Covered Offer, you shall promptly notify Africanjober of your Start Date and the key terms of such Covered Offer (and notify Africanjober promptly should that Start Date or offer terms change at any time), (2) you shall provide Africanjober with (a) a copy of a fully executed Covered Offer employment offer letter, or (b) execute a document between Employer, Africanjober and Prospective Employee that states material employment terms, including, among other things, Start Date and compensation, promptly upon the signing of a Covered Offer employment offer letter between you and such Employer (the “Effective Date”), as requested by Africanjober, and (3) you will promptly notify Africanjober after termination of your employment as an employee, intern, coop employee, consultant or contractor (“Employment”) in the event that (a) an Employer terminates your Employment based on unsatisfactory performance within ninety (90) days of the date on which your Employment commenced, or (b) you voluntarily terminate your Employment within ninety (90) days of the date on which your Employment commenced. In the event that before the Start Date, either Employer or Prospective Employee elect not to begin the employment relationship contemplated by the Covered Offer, Prospective Employee shall promptly notify Africanjober and such Prospective Employee shall not be eligible for the related Prospective Employee Payment. In the event that within ninety (90) days of the date on which your Employment commenced (4) an Employer terminates your Employment (other than as part of a reduction in force) or (5) you voluntarily terminate your Employment, and (6) you have received the Prospective Employee Payment, then Africanjober is entitled to the return of the Prospective Employee Payment and you shall promptly return that Prospective Employee Payment to Africanjober. The foregoing repayment amount is a debt immediately owed to Africanjober and the Prospective Employee will pay for any professional fees Africanjober incurs in enforcing such repayment obligation.</p>

              <p><b>For Employers</b> Once we have accepted the registration of an Employer, the Employer will be able to make Requests and contact (through the Service) Prospective Employees listed on our Site and Service. If a Prospective Employee identified through use of our Service accepts a Covered Offer within twelve (12) months of the date on which the Employer first viewed the Prospective Employee on the Site, the Employer will be charged a Success Fee. For purposes of this Agreement, “Success Fee” shall refer to both Upfront Success Fees and Monthly Success Fees, and shall be collected, as set forth below:</p>

              <p>In the case of an Employment engagement, the Employer may elect to pay one of the following two Success Fee options: 
                <ul>
                  <li>(1) the Employer may pay a Success Fee equal to 15% of the Prospective Employee’s first year base salary (an “Upfront Success Fee”), which amount shall be due and payable thirty (30) days after the Start Date (the “Upfront Success Fee Option”); OR </li>
                  <li>(2) in the event that Africanjober in its sole discretion has approved the Employer to pay on a monthly basis (the “Monthly Success Fee Option”), the Employer may pay a monthly Success Fee equal to 2% of the Employee’s first year base salary (a “Monthly Success Fee”), with the first payment due on the Start Date and each subsequent payment due monthly thereafter for ten (10) months until the earlier of (a) payment of ten Monthly Success Fee installments or (b) termination of the Prospective Employee for whom the Monthly Success Fee Option was selected.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <p>Employers granted the Monthly Success Fee option are required to (1) complete the Africanjober Direct Debit Authorization Form allowing Africanjober to directly withdraw, debit or charge monthly payments from Employer’s designated bank or credit card account(s) and (2) be subject to a credit review.</p>

              <p>In the event that the Employer selects the Monthly Success Fee Option and subsequently wishes to make payment in full, the Employer may contact Employer’s Account Manager or the Accounts or Admin Department at Africanjober to ascertain the amount required to buy out the remaining installments of the Monthly Success Fee.</p>

              <p>In the case of a Consulting Engagement within twelve (12) months of the date on which the Employer first viewed the contractor or consultant on the Site, the Employer shall pay a fee equal to 15% of the compensation to be paid for the period of such Consulting Engagement (the “Consulting Fee”). Employer shall provide Africanjober with a monthly compensation estimate of which 15% of this amount shall be due and payable thirty (30) days after the Start Date and each subsequent month of Consulting Engagement, for as long as the Consulting Engagement continues. If Prospective Employee works more or less than the monthly compensation estimate, Employer will inform Africanjober and future invoices will be modified accordingly.</p>

              <p>In the event that a Consulting Engagement results in the Prospective Employee accepting an Employment Offer, the Employer shall pay a Success Fee equal to 15% of the Prospective Employee’s first year base salary (the “Conversion Upfront Success Fee”), which amount shall be due and payable thirty (30) days after the Start Date. The Conversion Upfront Success Fee will be discounted by any prior Consulting Fee payments paid for such Prospective Employee. Employers choosing the Consulting Engagement option are required to (1) complete the Africanjober Direct Debit Authorization Form allowing Africanjober to directly withdraw, debit or charge monthly payments from Employer’s designated bank or credit card account(s), and (2) be subject to a credit review.</p>

              <p>Employers are required to promptly notify Africanjober once a Prospective Employee has accepted a Covered Offer and notify Africanjober of the Start Date for such Prospective Employee (including prompt notification of any subsequent changes in such Start Date.) Employers shall provide Africanjober with (1) a copy of a fully executed Covered Offer employment offer letter, or (2) execute a document between Employer, Africanjober and Prospective Employee that states material employment terms, including, among other things, Start Date and compensation promptly upon the Effective Date. In the event that before the Start Date, either Employer or Prospective Employee elect not to begin the employment relationship contemplated by the Covered Offer, Employer shall promptly notify Africanjober and the Prospective Employee shall not be eligible for any Prospective Employee Payment.</p>

              <p>The Employer agrees to pay Africanjober a Success Fee for any Covered Offer which is accepted by a Prospective Employee within twelve (12) months of the date on which the Employer first viewed the Prospective Employee on the Site, as defined above.</p>

              <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a Success Fee dispute, if an Employer can establish that the Employer had an Active Process (as defined below) with the Prospective Employee before using our Site and/or Service (e.g., the Prospective Employee had already begun the interview process with the Employer and such process had not been terminated, or the Employer had received the Prospective Employee’s CV from an employment agency or headhunter and was under active consideration by the Employer), the Employer may be exempted from paying the Success Fee. However, the final determination as to whether a Success Fee is owed by the Employer for an accepted Covered Offer will be at the sole discretion of Africanjober. For the purposes hereof, “Active Process” shall mean continuous direct, back & forth communication, in an active recruiting or hiring context where a decision to put a candidate on hold or reject has not been made, within the three (3) months prior to using the Site or Service for a Prospective Employee that exists in Employer’s applicant tracking system or that was submitted by a recruiting agency. The Prospective Employee agrees to repay any Prospective Employee Payment on first demand from Africanjober where Africanjober waived any Success Fee payable by the Employer due to an Active Process. The foregoing repayment amount is a debt immediately owed to Africanjober and the Prospective Employee will pay for any professional fees Africanjober incurs in enforcing such repayment obligation.</p>

              <p>IF YOU ARE AN EMPLOYER who is using our Site and/or Service, YOU agree to the Success Fee provisions. If you do not agree with any of the provisions of this Agreement, please terminate your account immediately and cease using Africanjober. YOUR OBLIGATION TO PAY ANY SUCCESS FEES SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>

              <p>If an Employer circumvents our Site and/or Service after discovering a Prospective Employee through our Site and/or Service and subsequently hires that Prospective Employee within twelve (12) months of the date on which the Employer first viewed the Prospective Employee on the Site, the Employer will pay on first demand and Africanjober may invoice the Employer a Success Fee equal to 15% of the first year base salary or prorated contractor/consultant compensation of the Prospective Employee and Africanjober may, in its sole discretion, terminate the Employer’s account.</p>

              <p><b>Payment</b> Employer agrees to pay the Success Fees charged to Employer’s account in accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time the Success Fee is due and payable hereunder. Employers choosing the Monthly Success Fee, Consulting Engagement or the Membership option acknowledge and agree that the same is conditional upon completion of the Africanjober Direct Debit Authorisation Form allowing Africanjober to directly withdraw, debit or charge monthly payments from Employers' designated bank or credit card account(s). By accepting Africanjober Terms of Service, Employer agrees that Africanjober is authorised to immediately withdraw Success Fees due and payable to Africanjober hereunder from Employer’s account and that no additional notice or consent is required. Employer agrees to immediately notify Africanjober of any change in its billing address or any account information provided to Africanjober used for payment hereunder. Failure by the Employer to pay or provide sufficient details to Africanjober to establish the payment process described above may result in the temporary or permanent suspension and/or termination by Africanjober of this Agreement, at its sole discretion.</p>

              <p><b>Changes in Fees and Billing Methods</b> Africanjober reserves the right at any time to change its fees (including to begin charging for services that it is currently providing free of charge) and billing methods, either immediately upon posting updated Terms of Use on the Site or by email delivery to you.</p>

              <p><b>Refunds</b> At Africanjober we value Employers' satisfaction in using our Site and Service to hire great Prospective Employees. If (1) an Employer hires a Prospective Employee and terminates the Prospective Employee’s Employment based on unsatisfactory performance within ninety (90) days of the Start Date, or (2) a Prospective Employee voluntarily terminates his or her Employment within ninety (90) days of the Start Date, or (3) Prospective Employee does not start Employment because either Employer or Prospective Employer elects not to begin the employment relationship contemplated in the Covered Offer (each, a “Termination Event”), upon written receipt and confirmation of such information, Africanjober will fully refund to the Employer the Upfront Success Fee related to the Prospective Employee who was the subject of the Termination Event (if such Upfront Success Fee was paid by Employer prior to the Termination Event) and the Prospective Employee agrees to repay any Prospective Employee Fee on first demand from Africanjober. In the event that the Employer was paying a Monthly Success Fee for the Prospective Employee who was the subject of the Termination Event, no refund shall be owed to the Employer; however, the Employer’s obligation to pay future Monthly Success Fees shall terminate as of the date on which the Prospective Employee’s Employment terminates. No refunds shall be provided for Conversion Upfront Success Fees or for Membership programs.</p>
