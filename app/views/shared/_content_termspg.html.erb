Please be aware that when you subscribe to our premium plan, you will become liable for automatic renewal billing. THIS MEANS THAT THE MINIMUM DURATION OF YOUR CONTRACT WILL BE FOR THE INITIAL PERIOD YOU SELECT (EG. 1 MONTH), AND THIS WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR SERVICE.

For example if you pay by credit card, we will continue to debit this same credit card as each subscription period expires. We will only debit these repeat payments when your current payment period expires and not before.</p>

Continuous service rates apply to credit/debit card payments only and are applicable both if you join as a member online or we manually process your card details. All amounts are billed in UK sterling, $ or €, dependent on the country in which you reside, at the beginning of each renewal period.

Some Organizers or Creators or Hosts may require or request fees for participation in a spefz social, or for attendance at spefz social or spefz events. Individual spefz group membership fees, spefz social fees or other event fees are at the discretion of each Organizer or Creator or Host, who decides whether such fees are required, the amount frequency, payment options, refund policies, and how such fees are spent. Fees assessed by Organizers or Creators or Hosts are remitted to the Organizer or Creator or Host and not to spefz. To the extent that you use Amazon Payments, PayPal or another payment mechanism (e.g., check or cash), to pay fees assessed by an Organizer or Creator or Host, you acknowledge that spefz does not control the transaction, and that you bear all risk in connection with the transaction.

Organizers or Creators or Hosts have full discretion whether and how to spend money in connection with their spefz socials or events. We cannot ensure that an Organizer or Creator or Host is legitimate and truthful, that he or she will use payments as promised, or that you will be happy with how your payment is spent. Your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in promotions of spefz events/socials, including payment and related services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and the applicable Organizer or Creator or Host.</p>

                  <li>(a) We guarantee a minimum of 8 dates at any regular speed event. If you meet less than 8 people at any one event. No refunds will be granted. Our host has the discretion to call an event off in extreme circumstances when an event is not viable. If you choose to leave an event which goes ahead as planned you are not eligible for a refund or rebook regardless of the circumstances.</li>

                  <li>(b) Some social events such as wine tasting etc require a minimum of 12 guests to go ahead. If the minimum is not met you will be offered a half price ticket to another social event, or a free ticket to a regular speed  event or party.</li>

                  <li>While we aim to have a 50/50 gender split at every event, this is not guaranteed and may not always be possible due to no shows etc. At regular speed events. At the large parties, a minimum of 40/60 will be achieved in the gender balance. No refunds will be issued for imbalanced numbers due to the unpredictability of 'no shows'.</li>

                  <li>(d) If you arrive late for an event, entry will not be guaranteed, and all late arrivals will be permitted to join the event at the host’s discretion. If you are late, and admittance is denied by the host who will act reasonably and in the best interest of the group of attendees as a whole, you are not eligible for any credit or refund. We consider a late arrival to mean any attendee who arrives later than 10 minutes prior to the event’s listed start time. Attendance on time is essential to allow you to sign in and get a drink before the event starts.</li>

                  <li>(e) Venues have their own requirements such as dress code and ID checks. Booking an event is no guarantee that a venue will allow you to enter the premises if you are in breach of any venue code of conduct, dress code, or fail to provide ID if so requested by the venue. Guests are encouraged to check venue websites directly for accuracy. As a general rule we recommend smart/casual attire. Do not wear sneakers/tracksuits or football colours. Many venues operate a 'no ID, no entry policy'. This is not to verify ages but as a general security policy, particularly with venues operating a late licence. This means that we ask all guests to bring ID. This applies whether you look 20 or 60! Please follow venue guidelines and if you are turned away from a venue for not being able to provide ID or are dressed in appropriate attire, no refunds/credits will be issued.</li>
