Please be aware that when you subscribe to our premium plan, you will become liable for automatic renewal billing. THIS MEANS THAT THE MINIMUM DURATION OF YOUR CONTRACT WILL BE FOR THE INITIAL PERIOD YOU SELECT (EG. 1 MONTH), AND THIS WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR SERVICE.

For example if you pay by credit card, we will continue to debit this same credit card as each subscription period expires. We will only debit these repeat payments when your current payment period expires and not before.</p>

Continuous service rates apply to credit/debit card payments only and are applicable both if you join as a member online or we manually process your card details. All amounts are billed in UK sterling, $ or €, dependent on the country in which you reside, at the beginning of each renewal period.

Some Organizers or Creators or Hosts may require or request fees for participation in a spefz social, or for attendance at spefz social or spefz events. Individual spefz group membership fees, spefz social fees or other event fees are at the discretion of each Organizer or Creator or Host, who decides whether such fees are required, the amount frequency, payment options, refund policies, and how such fees are spent. Fees assessed by Organizers or Creators or Hosts are remitted to the Organizer or Creator or Host and not to spefz. To the extent that you use Amazon Payments, PayPal or another payment mechanism (e.g., check or cash), to pay fees assessed by an Organizer or Creator or Host, you acknowledge that spefz does not control the transaction, and that you bear all risk in connection with the transaction.

Organizers or Creators or Hosts have full discretion whether and how to spend money in connection with their spefz socials or events. We cannot ensure that an Organizer or Creator or Host is legitimate and truthful, that he or she will use payments as promised, or that you will be happy with how your payment is spent. Your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in promotions of spefz events/socials, including payment and related services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and the applicable Organizer or Creator or Host.</p>

              <p class="major_header">Events
                <ul>
                  <li>(a) We guarantee a minimum of 8 dates at any regular speed event. If you meet less than 8 people at any one event. No refunds will be granted. Our host has the discretion to call an event off in extreme circumstances when an event is not viable. If you choose to leave an event which goes ahead as planned you are not eligible for a refund or rebook regardless of the circumstances.</li>

                  <li>(b) Some social events such as wine tasting etc require a minimum of 12 guests to go ahead. If the minimum is not met you will be offered a half price ticket to another social event, or a free ticket to a regular speed  event or party.</li>

                  <li>While we aim to have a 50/50 gender split at every event, this is not guaranteed and may not always be possible due to no shows etc. At regular speed events. At the large parties, a minimum of 40/60 will be achieved in the gender balance. No refunds will be issued for imbalanced numbers due to the unpredictability of 'no shows'.</li>

                  <li>(d) If you arrive late for an event, entry will not be guaranteed, and all late arrivals will be permitted to join the event at the host’s discretion. If you are late, and admittance is denied by the host who will act reasonably and in the best interest of the group of attendees as a whole, you are not eligible for any credit or refund. We consider a late arrival to mean any attendee who arrives later than 10 minutes prior to the event’s listed start time. Attendance on time is essential to allow you to sign in and get a drink before the event starts.</li>

                  <li>(e) Venues have their own requirements such as dress code and ID checks. Booking an event is no guarantee that a venue will allow you to enter the premises if you are in breach of any venue code of conduct, dress code, or fail to provide ID if so requested by the venue. Guests are encouraged to check venue websites directly for accuracy. As a general rule we recommend smart/casual attire. Do not wear sneakers/tracksuits or football colours. Many venues operate a 'no ID, no entry policy'. This is not to verify ages but as a general security policy, particularly with venues operating a late licence. This means that we ask all guests to bring ID. This applies whether you look 20 or 60! Please follow venue guidelines and if you are turned away from a venue for not being able to provide ID or are dressed in appropriate attire, no refunds/credits will be issued.</li>
                </ul>

B.12. SAFE MODE AND VERIFIED MEMBERS
In order to provide our members with a safer user experience, we offer both the "Safe Mode" feature as well as the ability for any member to become a "Verified Member."
"Safe Mode" enables members to limit certain types of actions and information that the Website can provide, including search results and incoming communications. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue Safe Mode at any time and we reserve the right to limit Safe Mode or parts of it to paying members. Additional information regarding Safe Mode is available on the Website or by contacting us through our "Contact Us" page.
A "Verified Member" is any user who has validated the phone number connected with their account as being held by a human person, by either:
(1) obtaining a unique verification code by text message or voice call;
(2) calling the Website's toll-free number; or
(3) providing credit card information.
The Website uniquely identifies Verified Members. Verified Members have access to special features such as being able to search for other Verified Members. We reserve the right to remove or modify the Verified Member feature at any time and without any prior notice. You understand that we assume no liability related to any user abusing the Verified Member feature or providing inaccurate, false or fraudulent information in the verification process. You further understand that the Verified Member feature is not a guarantee of the genuine or genuine intentions of a person. Additional information regarding the Verified Member feature is available on the Website.
