Can I bring a friend?
You are very welcome to come speed dating with friends. Lots of people do. You can also bring your friends along that are not taking part in speed dating, but we normally do not allow them to stay in the event room once the dating commences. In most of our venues, your friends can stay in the public area. However, in some venues this is not an option as we may have exclusive use of the whole venue. If in doubt please phone us to check.




How can I book an additional ticket for a friend?
First of all you should know that when you are booking an event for a friend you will need to create an account for them. Once you have selected the event you wish to attend and entered your details, simply change the number of tickets you need on the payment page. Enter your friend’s first and last name, city/postcode, their date of birth and address. Alternatively you can call us on 0131 608 0066 (local call rate £1 telephone booking fee) and book a ticket for your friend



How can I pay for a ticket to an event? What are the booking line opening hours?
For bookings and general enquiries the call centre is available 24/7 on 0131 608 0066. A £1 telephone booking fee will apply to bookings made over the phone. All requests and escalated complaints are dealt with by management, please call during office hours (9.30am-6pm Monday to Friday).

Please note we no longer accept payment by cheque or postal order. 

If you have problems with your debit/credit card, please call us on 0131 608 0066 to discuss if an alternative payment option is available. Cash payments can be made at our singles parties on the door (depending on availability of course), however this will be at full price and any early bird discounts will not be applied.

How do I book a ticket to an event?
At the top of every page is a panel, where you can search events by city/type/age/date. Once you have made your selection just click the “Find” button. The next page to be displayed will show the event results from your selection. To view more information on an event just click the image, or the 'book now' link for the event you are interested in. This will display the full info for the event, including venue and travel info. Once you are ready to book, just click on the 'book now' button. Alternatively you can call us on 0131 608 0066 (local call rate. Plus a £1 telephone booking fee).

How do I find out the location of SpeedDater events?
Just use the panel at the top of every page to choose your city, then click 'Find'. You'll then see a list of all events in your city sorted by date. To view more information about the location click on the 'book now' link on the event you are interested in and from there you will find information about the venue and the location, below the main event description.

How do matches/ticks and emails work?
After attending a speed dating event you are able to tick other members and to see who ticked you. 2 mutual yes ticks is a 'dating' match, 1 'yes' and 1 'friend' is a 'friendship' match and so is 2 mutual 'friend' ticks. We do send a courtesy email the next day telling you the event is open for you to enter these ticks, but don't rely on this as they sometimes go into junk folders. You don't need the email; simply log in using your email and password. Then, just click on the 'Matches' tab. You will now be taken to a screen which will have your events listed on it. Click on 'add ticks' and then simply apply yes/no/friend as relevant. Matches will show immediately after you have saved your ticks. Remember to keep checking back, as some people may not have entered their ticks yet. You can check that by clicking the link 'Click here to see if the people you ticked have entered their ticks yet'. You can also check how many ticks you received at the event. Click the 'click here to check your yes ticks' link and you'll see a list of people who ticked you. Please note once you have entered ticks, they can not be changed. Please choose carefully! If you are a bit unsure, go for it, you have nothing to lose! After entering ticks you can send a message to anyone who attended, it's free and unlimited. Please note - parties and activity events do not have an 'add ticks' option. Instead you can view attendees, and contact anyone you like for free for an unlimited length of time.

How many dates will I have at a speed dating event?
Our maximum amount of dates at a speed dating event is approximately 20. Our minimum amount of dates is 8. London typically gets between 15-20 dates and other UK cities around 10-15 dates.

How should I dress for speed dating?
Wear what you feel comfortable in. Many people will be coming straight from work so suits are fine - don't forget that in speed dating first impressions count.

I can't make an event. Can I send a friend instead?
Yes, you can send a friend of the same gender in your place for no additional charge. Please call us on 0131 608 0066 so that we can register your friend. If your friend is the opposite gender we may still be able to help you. Please call us to check.

I ticked someone for dating but only have a friendship match with them. Why?
You only receive a 'dating' match if both people select dating. If one person chooses dating and the other chooses friendship it comes up as a 'friendship' match. If both people choose friendship it is also a friendship match. 
A summary of matches: 

Match + Match = Dating Match 

Match + Friend = Friendship Match 

Friend + Friend = Friendship Match 

Match + No = No Match 

Friend + No = No Match 

No + No = No Match

Is it a good idea to prepare a list of questions to ask people?
It's a good idea to have a few questions up your sleeve in case you run out of things to say. However, it's a very bad idea to have a scripted list of questions as it kills the spontaneity of a four minute date. Try and let it flow more naturally. Find out what you have in common and go from there.

What happens when I arrive at the event?
When you arrive you will see a SpeedDater Host in a t-shirt who will register you and give you a scorecard, a name badge and a pencil. Once everyone has arrived the SpeedDater host will explain how speed dating works and answer any questions. Then the dating begins. Usually women will stay seated while men rotate every four minutes when the bell rings. After each date participants mark on a scorecard whether they would like to see that person again. At the end of the evening many people stay around to chat to the people they've just met.

What is the SpeedDater guarantee?
SpeedDater Guarantee SpeedDater guarantees that you will meet someone you would like to see again at each PAID SpeedDater event. If you do not meet someone you would like to see again you can come to another SpeedDater event free of charge. The guarantee only offers free tickets to events you have not already booked for. We will not refund tickets already booked for future events under the guarantee. If you tick 'yes' or 'friend' for anyone you have met at a SpeedDater event you have indicated that you would like to see them again and therefore do not qualify for a free ticket to a future event. If you are using the guarantee on a ticket that you bought for a discounted price, you must pay the balance when claiming the guarantee. The guarantee is also limited to one free ticket per paid for ticket. The guarantee may not be rolled over. If you claim your guarantee and then do not tick anyone again at your free event, you may not claim another guarantee. To qualify for a free ticket under the guarantee you must take part in the whole event. If you leave early or choose not to take part you do not qualify. The SpeedDater guarantee does not apply to special bigger ticket events such as days and evenings out (cooking classes, walks, wine tasting, ping pong etc) or to SpeedDater Lock and Key Parties or SpeedDater Balls. Guarantees may not be used to book these special events. The SpeedDater guarantee remains valid for three months from the date of the original event. For Elite events, the value of the guarantee is limited to a ticket to a normal speed dating event (i.e. not exceeding £25). If purchasing a ticket to an Elite event with a guarantee, you must pay the difference in price. The guarantee also does not apply to complimentary tickets. For further information see our Terms and Conditions

What sort of people go speed dating?
Most speed daters are professionals who want to meet more people. They're generally normal, attractive people who just aren't meeting people through their work or immediate circle of friends.
